# Ad Blocker Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension blocks ads from loading on web pages, ensuring a faster and cleaner browsing experience. It hides ad containers and prevents common ad networks from serving ads, giving you a distraction-free environment.

## Features:
- Blocks ads from DoubleClick, Google Ad Services, and other ad networks.
- Hides ad elements (like banners, pop-ups, and sponsored content) on various websites.
- Improves page performance by preventing resource-heavy ad scripts.
- Customizable rules to easily extend the ad-blocking capabilities.

## How It Works

1. **Blocking Ad URLs**: 
   The extension uses Chromeâ€™s `declarativeNetRequest` API to block requests to known ad domains like `doubleclick.net`, `googleadservices.com`, and others. You can also add your own ad URLs to the blocking list.

2. **Hiding Ad Elements**:
   The extension scans the web page for elements that typically host ads (like banners and pop-ups) using CSS selectors. It hides those elements to remove blank spaces where ads might have been displayed.

3. **Auto-updates on Page Load**:
   Every time a page loads, the extension checks for ad elements and hides them using the custom CSS rules. It runs automatically without manual intervention.
